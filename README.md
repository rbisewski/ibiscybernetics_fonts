# ibiscybernetics_fonts

Librefonts created for company projects and websites, that are both free 
and opensource.

Mostly they were inspired by arcade-style fonts, and included is both the
FontForge project file for editting, and a generated output in the form of
a TrueType font for quick and easy usage.

Currently two fonts are available, EightBit (medium) and UltraThin (thin).

## EightBit

A medium font that is fairly bold, and is based on older arcade games with
limited numbers of pixels. This could be used as a retro video game font.

## UltraThin

A thin font that resembles more modern looking pixel fonts, and it is both
easy to read and is neatly spaced. Comparable to the font used in more
recent video games with 2D graphics, such as FTL.
